## Project Summary
Course Reco acts as a Grainger course recommendation app that helps engineering students find a set of courses that they can take next to fulfill their major requirements. Based on the user’s interests and completed prerequisites, our application utilizes databases from platforms such as “Rate My Professor,” “UIUC GPA Disparity,” and “Course Catalog” to create a list of tailored course suggestions that are relevant for the user. Additionally, the application uses a weighting system that ranks these course suggestions based on the user’s preferences for what classes they are looking for. These preferences can include what grade they want in the class, how many credit hours the class is, how hard the professor is, and whether it is online or in person. Our goal for this project is to create an efficient way for users to make informed decisions when selecting their classes, optimizing their college experience and academic success.
